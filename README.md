# TT-Toolbox
Well-documented Tensor-Train Toolbox for MATLAB.


Contributor policy
====================
This project is now following the _git flow_ approach. Namely:

- branch `master` is only for stable versions and releases;
- branch `develop` is main working branch;
- contributor should create new branch for certain feature and then merge with `develop` branch as feature was done;
- each release on `master` branch should correspond to package release to MATLAB Central
- A maintainer is selected that checks all the pull request 

A pull request should satisfy the following requirements:
- style and quality description of pull request;
- new changes should be tested and shouldn't break anything;
- pull request for one fix or one feature(could be several commits);
- try to keep the code style of the project;


Initialization
====================

- Run setup.m to add all directories to the Matlab path.
